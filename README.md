# GVM

- [x] get vue cli and setup front end
- [x] wire it up to the backend with gorilla mux
- [ ] maybe get 'fresh' setup to rebuild js and go code on change for frontend/backend hot code reloading
- [ ] get the database and go-migrate setup
- [ ] figure out authentication
- [ ] add CRUD for the resources
- [ ] add front end testing (maybe cypress?)
